# Design

### Colour scheme

I wanted to keep the colours fun and matching with the pokemon theme. The main pages follow the design of a pokeball, red - black - white. Other features like the back up button and the delete modal follow the pokemon logo colours, blue - yellow

# Bug fixes

- I had accidentally added the path to the post_detail page outside of the urlpatterns brackets.
- There was a bug that would throw an error when the socials page is clicked when a user isn't logged in. That got fixed with an if else statement.
- If a user would comment on a post and then refresh, the comment would duplicate. I had to add HttpResponseRedirect to the comment form.
- After I would update my profile picture it would return me to the incorrect user profile. I had to return the correct user pk.
- The update profile message wans't showing, I had placed the message code in the wrong section.
- The edit comment button stopped working, because I had accidentally deleted the .id in the comment.

<b>I have not noticed any existing bugs.</b>
